# RozCMP
RozCMP, developed by ROZBUD, is a 'Binary Comparison Tool' utilized in Reverse Engineering to display and create a Differences file.
This file is compatible with both X64DBG and ROZDLL, enabling the conversion of standard patches created by typical patchers like DUP2 and AT4Re into Hijacked DLL's.

Why we need it?
 
1- Compare 2 Binary Files, Executables or Dynamic Link Libraries (Original & the Cracked one).
2- Save differences to a file with the extension *.1337, so you can open it in x64dbg.
3- Save differences to a file with the extension *.roz, so you can open it in RozDll.
